					Step 2:  Finding Information
				</h1>
				<p class="description">
					Now that you’ve carefully made a list of the principles and goals you want out of your candidate,
					you are ready to find evidence to select your him, or her, in the most unbiased manner possible.
					<br />Finding unbiased and unfiltered information may require some searching. Below are a few
					suggestions to get you on the right track.
					<br />
					<b>
						Speech/Debate Transcripts
					</b>
					<br />
					The biggest strength in using a transcript is not having quotes
					or statements taken out of context. A proper transcript should include the
					entire text of what was said by the candidate(s) in the speech or debate.
					<br />In this way, you will get a better understanding of why the candidates made
					the statements they did, and not only get an unfiltered view of their
					principles, but the whole story as well.
					<br />If possible, find more than one transcript of a certain speech or debate.
					Some media sources may leave certain segments or bits of information out to
					better suit their narrative. By finding consistent information from more
					than one source, you can be more confident that your findings reflect reality
					and the truth.
					<br />
					<b>
						Filmed Speeches/Debates
					</b>
					<br />
					Upon reading a transcript, you may find that some of the responses or statements
					might not make sense, or even be controversial. Having footage of the speech or 
					debate will help you understand the speaker’s tone, and context of the situation.
					<br />When searching for filmed speeches or debates, especially if you are opting to 
					not use transcripts, try to find complete, unedited versions of the event. Only
					watching segments of the speech or debate will not give you complete context of
					the situation, or provide you with reasoning for why certain discussions or
					statements took place.
					<br />Lastly, make sure that the footage you are watching does not have a commentator.
					The commentator may sway you towards a certain candidate using his or her own
					bias. If you want your decision to be truly your own, you will need to remove 
					as many of these external influencing factors as possible.
					<br />
					<b>
						Statements
					</b>
					<br />
					Statements released by candidates tend to be well-articulated pieces of writing
					on issues brought up during the election. 
					<br />These statements are an easy way of
					determining the stance of the candidate on certain issues, and how they will
					accomplish them.  
					<br />Similar to the previous headings, find the complete statements
					which do exclude any sections. An incomplete statement may compromise the stance
					they are trying to make, and the message they are trying to send you.
					<br />Use the list(s) you made in the first step to select your candidate based on the
					unfiltered, unedited events.
